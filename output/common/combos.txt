On the (Triggered By) tabs in the Combo Editor, you will see a list of all
of the weapon types that can trigger combos.

At present, these flags work for the following weapon types:

	Boomerang		:
	Bomb			: Bomb Explosions
	Super Bomb		: Superbomb Explosions
	Lit Bomb		: Placed (Unexploded) Bomb

	Arrow			: 
	Fire			: Fire from ANY source.

Triggered By (2)
	Script/Custom 1		:
	Script/Custom 2		:
	Script/Custom 3		:
	Script/Custom 4		:
	Script/Custom 5		:
	Script/Custom 6		:
	Script/Custom 7		:
	Script/Custom 8		:
	Script/Custom 9		:
	Script/Custom 10	:

You may specify a minimum weapon level on [Triggered By (1)].
If you set a minimum, then it applies as the minimum level to all 
weapon interactions with the combo.

If the combo is struck by one of the selected weapon types, and 
the weapon qualifies for the minimum level (if any), then the combo 
will produce EVENTS based on the attributes that you set.

If a weapon is spoofing another type, such as an arrow set to Weapon Type
Sword in the Item Editor, then the combo will react only to the spoofed type.

Generic Triggers

	This combo type allows you to set the outcome of being triggered by
	one of the specified weapons. All of its mechanics are governed by
	the vrious flags, attributes, and properties that you set.

		but scripts can access them. 
	Flags
		The following are the flags available for this combo type,
		and the effects of each flag:
		
		Visuals
			If enabled, triggering the combo will spawn
			a visual effect. This interacts with the CLIPPINGS
			flag to determine the type of effect, and the value
			used for the effect is set from the SPRITE field.
		Itemdrop
			If enabled, the combo will drop an item when triggered.
			This interacts with the following flags:
				Specific Item, Room Item
		SFX
			If enabled, then triggering the combo will play a sound
			specified in the SOUND field.
		Next
			If enabled, when triggered, the combo will be replaced
			by the next combo in the list, or by the Screen Undercombo.
			This interacts with the following flags:
				Continuous, Undercombo
		Continuous
			If enabled, and the NEXT flag is also enabled, then the combo
			will be continually replaced in the same frame by the next combo
			if its type matches, and it also has the Next and Continuous flags
			set. Once the next possible combo differs, or does not have these 
			flags set, then the event stops. 
			This interacts with the following flags:
				Next
		Room Item
			If set, then triggering the combo will spawn an item with an ID
			matching the Room Special Item. 
		No Poof

			matching the value of the Secret Type field.

			is immediately set to Dead, destroying the weapon. 
		Engine/Flag 9
			This flag is only for Custom (e.g. Script 1 to 20) combo types.

			for this combo in the Combo Editor will transform to match those of
			the 'Generic' combo type.

				Visuals
		Specific Item
			If enabled, and the Itemdrop flag is also enabled, then instead of dropping
			an item from  Dropset, the combo will drop a specific item with an ID matching
			the value of the Dropset field.
			This interacts with the following flags:
				Itemdrop
		Undercombo
			If enbled, and the Next flag is also enabled, then instead of advancing to the
			next combo in the list when triggered, the combo will be replaced by the Screen
			Undercombo.
			This interacts with the following flags:
				Next
		Always Drop
			Not implemented at this time.
		Drop Enemy
			If enabled, the combo will spawn an enemy instead of an item when triggered.
			The enemy that is spwns will have an ID matching the value of the Dropset field,
			and appears at the location of the triggered combo.
			If the combo is not  'Next' trigger, then it is possible to repeatedly spawn
			enemies from it.
			If the No Poof flag is lso enabled, then the enemy will apper without its spawn
			sprite animation first occurring. Otherwise, it spawns in fifteen frames after
			the combo is triggered, following the spawn poof.
