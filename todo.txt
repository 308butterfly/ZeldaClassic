To-Do

MOVE the code from zq_custom.cpp that populates custom weapon
sprites for npcs, into the quest loader.
	THEN, make the weapon sprite a pulldown, offset by +1
	so, the list can hav e NONE as case 0, which is translated
	to a value of -1 for the field.
	Read the field and adjust it by 1 when the dialogue opens. 

Set new refs to -1 on bad load, and wrap the macros so that if the
ref is -1, they do not try to access data members.
e.g. ri->shopsref = -1
( if ri->shopsref != -1 ) 
This will prevent the user from loading data from ref 0, without
causing crashes. 

npc defence stun, no stunlock

Extra dropsets: stun dropset, frozen dropset.

FFCore ButtonRules: A (use item), B (use item), 
	L (inventory left), R (inventory right)
	Disable / enable by script.
Tooltips for all new stuff. Try to improve extant tooltips
and provide tooltip chains.

Subscreen scrolling speed variable. 

Datatypes:
rgbdata
palette

Enemy flag to block brangs if the npc is already stunned.
...or just a defence type, stun(no stunlock). 
Add magic powder, and an npc var: transform.
The 'transform' var can be an enemy defence (as can split, tribble)!

Might Do:

 -> THis requires some changes that I am not sure that we are keeping, so I may leave it out of 2.54.
