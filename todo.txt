New fonts. 
Made global special types and arrays legal.
Added comment blocks to ZScript. 

Might Do:
Weapon -> Defence Redirection / Weapon Editor Stuff
 -> THis requires some changes that I am not sure that we are keeping, so I may leave it out of 2.54. 
Enemy Editor Enemy Sizing (Seems as if it should be fine.)

Would be nice:
snap ffcs to grid. Contextiual menu->Snap FFC To grid?
display combo positions as overlay via zq menu option
