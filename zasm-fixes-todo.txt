Screen-> ScriptEntry ScriptOccupancy and ExitScript appear to be totally 
	unused; presumably intended for screen scripts that run upon entering, 
	while occupying, and upon exiting a screen.
Screen->NumFFCs is a 32-bit flagset, where each bit represents 
	if that index'd FFC is combo 0 or not.
	Being 32-bits, I presume the script access is not totally functional (the *10000 would truncate it)

itemdata->CollectFlags references an unused variable, but it has this comment on it: A flagset that determines of the weapon can collect an item.

mapscr.valid (Screen->Valid):
	set to mVERSION in readmaps, reset_scr

In zquest.cpp draw(), draw_block(), flood(), fill_4, and a bunch of other functions, it is |='d with mVALID

So, I'd say that Screen->Valid | mVERSION is always true, and 
	Screen->Valid | mVALID is true on INITIALIZED screens (i.e. screens where you have edited, which do not show as the default blank blue in ZQ)

Screen->TileWarpOverlayFlags/Screen->SideWarpOverlayFlags handle Combos Carry Over checkbox in the warp_dlg
	probably should be bool arrays
	
Ah, and Screen->SideWarpIndex can be removed, as my Screen->SideWarpID[4] is array access for that var.

Screen->NextMap and Screen->NextScreen appear to just access this:
