Azden.!A!c, Fuery.B!c!

Serveral of our users on Win10 have reported various types of flags from Windows Defender on our programme, including Azden and Feury flags.

We've tested building from clean, on completely fresh systems running Win7 with MSVC08, and with Win10 and MSVC17, and the issue persists.

I have tried to report this before, but I was unable to upload the file using Win10 and Edge.

I'm not sure what's happening here, but our software is open source, and we can provide the src files and libs if someone there wants to try determining the cause.
